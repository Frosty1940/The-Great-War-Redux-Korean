 # [mexico] Political Effort
 #=========================================================================
 mex_political_effort:0 "정치 주력" #link me pls
 mex_political_effort_desc:0 "The time for reform is now. While the nation has been fine under the guidance of the system of old for years, these turbulent times require a government that is in position to respond to them. Whether we choose to change our ways as a nation, or bolster our existing government to stand up to new external threats, political change can do nothing but benefit our nation and people's future."

 mex_ww1_sovereignist_ethos:0 "마데로의 민주주의 지원"
 mex_ww1_sovereignist_ethos_desc:0 "Francisco Madero has been arguing for a re-furbishing of Mexico's democracy, to return it to the more liberal and decentralized state it has been in the past. While critics argue that such a state is what was responsible for Mexico's decline since independence, it may be worth risking to avoid the implosion of the state."

 mex_ww1_Support_the_democracy:0 "민주주의 지원"
 mex_ww1_Support_the_democracy_desc:0 "It is said that any ruler, at their core, derives their power from the people. If we make a move towards a more democratic society, even if we don't become one ourselves, we can at the very least fall into a much nicer position to trade with the various democratic nations around the world."

 mex_ww1_centralizedpower:0 "노동 계획"
 mex_ww1_centralizedpower_desc:0 "In a time of war, or those immediately before or after, everyone has a job to do for their nation. If we put drifters, the homeless, and all of the other moochers who can't get a job to work on building for us, we can establish new manufacturies for nearly no cost, and the factory can even hire from the same labor pool if need be."

 mex_ww1_freespeech:0 "자유 연설"
 mex_ww1_freespeech_desc:0 "By giving the people the right to free speech and demonstration, we ensure that, at the very least, people can get their anger and stances out in a more creative way. Anybody who shouts ''FIRE!'' in a crowded movie theater, or uses any explitive to describe the Head of State's mother, is still going to prison."

 mex_ww1_reorganization_act:0 "재편성법"
 mex_ww1_reorganization_act_desc:0 "Much of our territory has been under the possession of various groups and individuals since civilization came to our humble nation. Over hundreds of years, however, much of this territory has been inefficiently laid out or used. By reorganizing the land and owners of our nation, particularly those that have been dormant, we can squeeze some of the newly displaced people into our factories."

 mex_ww1_full_rearmament:0 "혹독한 배급제"
 mex_ww1_full_rearmament_desc:0 "With our brave heroes actively defending the nation, they should have top priority for food and materials! Of course, the civilian population may resort to literally counting their beans and we might have a more restless population on our hands because of it, but if nothing else, our boys in uniform won't go hungry anytime soon."

 Mex_collectivist_ethos:0 "다른 혁명 지도자 지원" #link me pls
 Mex_collectivist_ethos_desc:0 "The old state is doomed to fall, taking our country with it unless we are to take extreme measures. By adopting a harsher stance, and moving our country towards a more extreme government form, we'll be able to protect ourselves and our national interests effectively in today's world."

 Mex_nationalism_focus:0 "판초 비야 지원"
 Mex_nationalism_focus_desc:0 "Pancho Villa has gotten a taste of power in Mexico, and has harshened his tone, becoming more of a hardline nationalist and pro-military. Perhaps he is the leader that will finally bring us above Uncle Sam..."

 mex_militarism:0 "군국주의"
 mex_militarism_desc:0 "Our growing military is becoming more and more a part of our nation's daily life. Luckily, popular support is favoring our troops currently, seeing them as the heroes fighting for our banner that they are. This military culture we are establishing is only furthering the cause of our armed forces."

mex_military_youth:0 "유소년 군사조직"
mex_military_youth_desc:0 "Our militaristic culture must even be present with the children! By drilling respect for the military, and even offering training to the younger generations, we can ensure that they grow up to enlist to serve our glorious regime. Some might call this exploitation, but it sounds better when you say you're giving teenagers a bright future."

mex_paramilitarism:0 "준군사주의"
mex_paramilitarism_desc:0 "Some nations are foolish enough to condemn armed civilian groups, for fear of rebellion. However, if we are careful to restrict these ad-hoc militias to loyalists to the regime, we can create yet another group of angry men with guns who support our nation, which could do us well in case of war."

mex_internationalism_focus:0 "에밀리아노 사파타 지원"
mex_internationalism_focus_desc:0 "Emiliano Zapata's message of extreme Socialism in Mexico- which, to put it bluntly, is nothing more than mere Communism- is a popular message indeed, especially in the very south of the country. Supporting his position could pacify the populace once and for all, even if it makes us slightly unpopular with the world's democracies."

mex_political_correctness:0 "정치적 올바름"
mex_political_correctness_desc:0 "Anyone who speaks out against our movement is clearly doing it as a hate crime towards the people we support with it. Therefore, anyone who speaks out the regime is to be closely watched, and, perhaps, unpersoned."

mex_indoctrination_focus:0 "세뇌"
mex_indoctrination_focus_desc:0 "After many years of debate on how to get rowdy anti-communist citizens to finally support our wonderful new regime, some of the men on the Worker's Council suggested the establishment of a new ''Ministry of Love'', which, officially, humanely persuades people to understand why they should support our government. We don't talk about what happens unofficially in there."

mex_political_commissars:0 "정치지도원"
mex_political_commissars_desc:0 "The military, ironically, is a place where anti-communist support thrives. By ensuring that our loving government has eyes everywhere, we can root out the dissent from these groups before it can rise."

mex_ww1_unitedpeople:0 "애국적 열정"
mex_ww1_unitedpeople_desc:0 "A motivated populace can do great things! By inspiring our people to rally around our sacred banner, we can easily win their hearts and minds, and string them along for, well, anything we want to do, really, so long as we have a reasonable enough opposing force to look like the good guys."

mex_ww1_massive_effort:0 "대규모 주력"
mex_ww1_massive_effort_desc:0 "Every man and woman must help our nation's efforts! With the spectre of the Great War floating over all, a great program has been undertaken to build up our industrial capacity to help us overcome our most hated rivals!"

mex_ww1_fortify_city:0 "민간 요새"
mex_ww1_fortify_city_desc:0 "When the fight comes to our borders, it's best to be prepared. By hiring construction workers to build up fortresses and bunkers on some of our outer provinces, we can safely hold off any enemy who dares attack us!"

mex_ww1_fortify_coast:0 "해안 방어"
mex_ww1_fortify_coast_desc:0 "A coastline is not an easy thing to defend. With ships able to land troops nearly anywhere coastal in our nation, Coastal Forts, which can help against marine invasions, are no difficult building to construct, and will help throw our enemies back into the ocean from whence they came."

mex_ww1_improve_our_puertos:0 "해군 개선"
mex_ww1_improve_our_puertos_desc:0 "Being at war, our navy remains weak before the enemy. This will help defend our ports."

mex_ww1_Restore_Autocracy:0 "권위주의 정권 복고"
mex_ww1_Restore_Autocracy_desc:0 "Perhaps this Democracy stuff isn't working so well after all. Madero is a fine president and all, but clearly the state needs more power and centralization. A General named Victoriano Huerta may be qualified to help the cause out here..."

mex_ww1_Unify_all_indigenous_languages:0 "토착민 통합"
mex_ww1_Unify_all_indigenous_languages_desc:0 "Even after all of these years, the many Central American native peoples still have not been truly integrated into our society. Are they not as well equipped to hold and fire a gun as the sons of Cortez? For the sake of our military manpower, this situation must come to an end!"

mex_support_revolucionary_forces:0 "혁명군 지원"
mex_support_revolucionary_forces_desc:0 "The forces of the Mexican public clearly have no more tolerance for the dictatorship in charge of the country. Of course, there are several roads to potentially go down after the deposition..."

mex_ww1_Take_Action:0 "재중앙집권화"
mex_ww1_Take_Action_desc:0 "Who needs native and individual rights when the Government could just keep all of them? New laws drafted to give more power to the government will help us exercize rule and establish some order in this tenuous state."

mex_ww1_preserve:0 "영웅주의"
mex_ww1_preserve_desc:0 "It seems that at least one man in every regiment has an amazing story to tell of valor and intrigue in battle, outsmarting a foe or pulling off some sort of amazing feat. Enshrining these men in our culture and giving them a special place in our divisions will drive the rest of our troops to attempt to emulate that same success."

mex_ww1_paramilitarism:0 "방어 중점"
mex_ww1_paramilitarism_desc:0 "If you want to see proof that the Mexican state is tired of the fighting within its own borders, just see the size of our fitting military recruits. We have to make the most of this. Extensive training given to second-rate forces may get them on the same level as our regulars."

MEX_ww1_Strengthen_military_forces:0 "군사력 강화"
MEX_ww1_Strengthen_military_forces_desc:0 "There are still areas where improvement can be made to our equipment and training practices. Anything to get a better army..."

MEX_ww1_Recluting_the_rebels:0 "저항군 사면"
MEX_ww1_Recluting_the_rebels_desc:0 "Several trained men from the Mexican Revolution simply want the opportunity to return home after a long, futile struggle. We cannot blame them. However, we can also put these skills to use. Guaranteeing safe passage home for these veterans in exchange for a year of service could help us put their skills to use and stop them from fighting our government once again!"

MEX_ww1_Rebuild_Mexico:0 "멕시코 재건"
MEX_ww1_Rebuild_Mexico_desc:0 "The revolution has left much shattered. We have to recover from this tragedy!"

MEX_ww1_Renew_the_republic:0 "디아스의 퇴임"
MEX_ww1_Renew_the_republic_desc:0 "President Diaz has served Mexico for well long enough. In his advanced age, he can no longer effecetively rule even the country he has won. His understudy, Victoriano Huerta, must take over for him."

MEX_ww1_supress_the_rebels:0 "저항군 은신처 습격"
MEX_ww1_supress_the_rebels_desc:0 "We arrested rebels who had a copy of the San Louis plan, along with notes mentioning specific hideouts and meeting places. Wonderful! If we send the troops into action, we can nip any sort of revolution in the bud."

MEX_ww1_support_diaz:0 "포르티리오 디아스 지원"
MEX_ww1_support_diaz_desc:0 "Bleeding-heart Rebels without much of a cause are still gathering against our government, against the prosperity and security the Porfiriato has bestowed upon them. All support we can muster from our society to keep the current administration in power is necessary."

mex_ww1_Save_Madero:0 "평화로운 전환"
mex_ww1_Save_Madero_desc:0 "The most important part of proving the legitimacy of our new constitution is the first transition of power. Ceding the legitimate owner of the state to the next President is quite important. Venustiano Carranza is gearing up for a run at office, and ensuring he will be able to take power if elected will prove that our Democracy works."

mex_ww1_subjugate_UPCA:0 "중앙아메리카 재합병"
mex_ww1_subjugate_UPCA_desc:0 "The states of Central America are weak, scattered nations, too small and prone to foreign influence to be of any value as independent countries. To remove this potential staging ground for our enemies we must re-establish a Central American union- even if it's in our own borders..."

mex_ww1_Lessons_of_war:0 "전쟁의 교훈"
mex_ww1_Lessons_of_war_desc:0 "The instability in Mexico has given many of our troops combat experience matched elsewhere only in Europe. If we can make the most out of this, it can be a nice silver lining in this dark cloud."

mex_ww1_2nd_Mexican_American_war:0 "아스틀란 수복"
mex_ww1_2nd_Mexican_American_war_desc:0 "Aztlán is the area of Northern Mexico stolen by the Estados Unidos so many years ago. We must stake a claim to the region in preperation for the Mexican government's return to the area. Of course, the war won't start quite yet, but this will put us on the road to revenge."

mex_ww1_Support_the_columbus_raid:0 "Support the Columbus Raid"
mex_ww1_Support_the_columbus_raid_desc:0 "Pancho Villa has plans to raid the town of Columbus in New Mexico to cause some havoc in Yankee territory. Perhaps if we egged him on a bit and supplied him, he would be more able to operate. Of course, this WOULD risk tempting the wrath of Uncle Sam, but it's not like the U.S. Army is that much of a threat to us anyway...right?"

mex_ww1_demand_belice:0 "벨리즈 요구"
mex_ww1_demand_belice_desc:0 "Belize is rightfully part of the Guatemalan territory that we now possess. Perhaps we should remind the United Kingdom of this before it comes to blows..."

mex_ww1_Reconquer_the_UPCA:0 "중앙아메리카 재정복"
mex_ww1_Reconquer_the_UPCA_desc:0 "The states of Central America are weak, scattered nations, too small and prone to foreign influence to be of any value as independent countries. To remove this potential staging ground for our enemies we must re-establish a Central American union- even if it's in our own borders..."

mex_ww1_Plan_of_San_Diego:0 "샌디에이고 계획"
mex_ww1_Plan_of_San_Diego_desc:0 "If we are to stand a chance against los Estados Unidos when it comes to blows, we must weaken their industry, population, and will to conduct a war. A succession of raids on border cities may do nicely! Of course, we may have to have a scapego- I mean, volunteer- to carry out these actions. Pancho Villa seems to be a reasonable start."

mex_ww1_Prepare_the_reconquista:0 "레콩키스타 준비"
mex_ww1_Prepare_the_reconquista_desc:0 "The humiliation of 1848 must be undone before it's too late! Call the White House and tell them that the Mexicans are coming over the border!"

mex_ww1_Stabilize_the_country:0 "국가 안정화"
mex_ww1_Stabilize_the_country_desc:0 "The country's turmoil seems to be over, at least temporarily. It is time to start picking up the pieces and building again from where we left off."

 # [mexico] Diplomatic Effort
 #=========================================================================
mex_ww1_diplomatic_effort:0 "외교 주력"
mex_ww1_diplomatic_effort_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly difficult to stay in the middle of the affairs in the world as it stands. Our diplomatic corps is already asking if we're to be involved in the coming power struggle, or if we are to stay out of things entirely. While we can't answer that question quite yet, we can easily expand our corps to be able to choose one of these options."

mex_ww1_takeposition:0 "자리 잡기"
mex_ww1_takeposition_desc:0 "Our place in the world is tenuous at best. After all, with the great empires at each others' throats, what's to stop one from turning on us once they're through? We must bet on the winning horse, and quickly, to ensure ourselves a place at the council of victors instead of as a footnote in a history book."

mex_ww1_supportgermany:0 "독일 지원"
mex_ww1_supportgermany_desc:0 "With the German Empire's massive industrial sector, they seem to be the clear-cut bet, even if they are diplomatically isolated. Showing public support to the Germans on even a few, non-key matters will send a message that we're moving closer to the Central Powers."

mex_ww1_supportfrance:0 "프랑스 지원"
mex_ww1_supportfrance_desc:0 "Though France's industry can't compete with Germany's, they have far more friends, and we'd even be one more. By supporting France on in a few of the upcoming diplomatic issues, we may just win them over."

mex_ww1_supportaustria:0 "오스트리아-헝가리 지원"
mex_ww1_supportaustria_desc:0 "The old empire of Austria-Hungary has lived to see the rise of most of the major nations on the world map. So, surely, if we want to become seen as a more major nation, what better country to support? This will also help us draw closer to the Central Powers."

mex_ww1_supportrussia:0 "러시아 지원"
mex_ww1_supportrussia_desc:0 "The Russian Empire is in pretty dire need of international help. For the nation whose former leader coined the term ''Sick Man of Europe'', they cannot be particularly healthy themselves. Our support will, if nothing else, help them hang on long enough to do something decisive."

mex_ww1_military_reserve:0 "예비군"
mex_ww1_military_reserve_desc:0 "War could easily come to our borders at a moment's notice, and therefore, we have to be prepared for the worst. A Military Reserve of loosely trained conscripts will be of little true value in the case of a war, but these impressionable young men getting a taste of the army life may very easily convince them to join the real thing."

mex_ww1_embargo_germany:0 "독일 제재"
mex_ww1_embargo_germany_desc:0 "Germany's illegal Submarine attacks are an insult to free trade! Though a sanction will draw us slightly further from neutrality, it will make us far harder to exploit by the merchants of the German Empire."

mex_ww1_embargo_france:0 "프랑스 제재"
mex_ww1_embargo_france_desc:0 "France's diplomatic scheming and backstabbing are unforgivable! Though a sanction will make us appear and act far less neutral in the war situation, it's unlikely to spiral into anything bad, and more importantly, will ensure France cannot take advantage of us!"

mex_ww1_sellweapons:0 "무기 판매"
mex_ww1_sellweapons_desc:0 "Though the tension of the world is the highest it's ever been, even this stormcloud has a silver lining. As we have no interest in joining the fight, we can easily hawk our weapons and weapon designs- even to both sides of a conflict, if we want- and make a killing off of the misfortunes of others. Their fault for starting the war."

mex_ww1_joingermany:0 "동맹국 가입"
mex_ww1_joingermany_desc:0 "The Central Powers have long been a friend to our nation, and desperately need help in these most uncertain times. Joining them is a one-way ticket into the war on their side, and we better be in it to win it if we are, but we could turn the tides to a decisive victory on their part."

mex_ww1_joinfrance:0 "협상국 가입"
mex_ww1_joinfrance_desc:0 "The Entente currently seem to be in the better position to win the war, and we wouldn't want to be caught missing the peace conference once they do. Joining the Entente will definitely pull us into war, which could wind up disastrously, but at least we'll have allies to help, right?"

mex_ww1_war_effort:0 "전쟁 주력"
mex_ww1_war_effort_desc:0 "With the world in its current state, we can't afford to let other nations pass over our military. By expanding our industrial base, we can ensure we'll have enough guns and shells to come out on top."

mex_ww1_equip_fra:0 "협상국 무기 수송"
mex_ww1_equip_fra_desc:0 "The French are prepared to pay top dollar for our rifles. Who are we to say no?"

mex_volunteer_corps:0 "의용군"

mex_Invite_COL:0 "콜롬비아 초청"
mex_Invite_COL_desc:0 "Colombia is not so distant from us, and their membership will almost make our alliance contiguous- with the seizure of Panama and Central America, of course, it will be. Obviously, their invitation should be a priority."

mex_Invite_Bolivia:0 "볼리비아 초청"
